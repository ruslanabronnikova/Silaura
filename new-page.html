          <p class="text-3 mt-3">Pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the
            actual
            teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes,
            or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure
            rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues
            or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which
            toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes
            laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with
            a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that
            produces no resultant pleasure?
